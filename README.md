This repository contains a cheat sheet for the Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence exam (HS2024).
The cheat sheet was adapted from the [cheat sheet by Nils Jensen](https://github.com/nilsejensen28/pai-summary).

Some content was removed and shortened, while other things were added.
Especially the reinforcement learning section was reworked.
The exact changes can be viewed [here](https://github.com/rgwohlbold/pai-cheat-sheet/commit/2c74d6451c464e93664d330855f0c94ba9a288b8).
